## Project Overview
This project utilizes consumer online behavioral data to predict offline purchase behavior. The analysis includes data profiling, machine learning model building, evaluation of models, and interpretation of the results. The primary goal is to achieve an accurate prediction model that can be used to optimize marketing efforts.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this project includes 1,171 records, each representing a unique user's online behavior. The key variables in the dataset include:
- **Pageviews**: Number of pages viewed by the user.
- **Time_On_Site**: Time spent on the site by the user.
- **Bounces**: Number of times the user bounced from the site.
- **Sessions**: Number of sessions initiated by the user.
- **Form_Submitted**: Whether the user submitted a form.
- **Primary_CTA_clicks**: Clicks on the primary Call-To-Action (CTA).
- **Secondary_CTA_clicks**: Clicks on the secondary CTA.
- **Tertiary_CTA_clicks**: Clicks on the tertiary CTA.
- **Product_Nav_clicks**: Clicks on product navigation links.
- **Product_Comparison_clicks**: Clicks on product comparison links.
- **Offline_Sale**: Whether the user made an offline purchase (target variable).

## Data Profiling
A thorough data profiling was conducted using YData Profiling to understand the dataset better. Key findings include:
- No missing data points.
- No duplicate rows.
- High correlation between `Form_Submitted` and `Pageviews`.

## Machine Learning Workflow

### Step 1: Train-Test Split
The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance. The target variable is `Offline_Sale`, and the features include various numerical variables related to user behavior.

### Step 2: Baseline Model with Logistic Regression
A logistic regression model was initially trained to establish a baseline for hyper-parameter tuning.

### Step 3: Confusion Matrix Calculation
A confusion matrix was calculated to evaluate the baseline modelâ€™s performance in predicting offline purchases.

### Step 4: Evaluation Metrics
Standard evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy, were calculated to assess the model's effectiveness.

### Step 5: Handling Imbalanced Data with SMOTE
The Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied to address the imbalanced nature of the dataset, ensuring that the model could learn effectively from both positive and negative cases.

### Step 6: Random Forest Classifier with Hyper-Parameter Tuning
A Random Forest Classifier was trained with hyper-parameter tuning to improve the model's predictive performance, focusing on optimizing the F1 score.

## Results and Interpretation
The best-performing model achieved significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1 score, indicating a more balanced and meaningful ability to predict offline purchases.

## Future Work
Further improvements can be made by:
- Fine-tuning the decision threshold to balance precision and recall.
- Exploring more advanced models, such as ensemble methods or deep learning approaches.
- Regularly updating the model with new data and incorporating additional behavioral metrics.
